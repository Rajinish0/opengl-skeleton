Just a starting point for opengl projects. The external libs were installed using vcpkg.

## Build Instructions

- install `vcpkg` (add it to your path too)
- run `./install_dependencies.ps1`
- run `./build_for_vs.ps1`
- go to build, open .sln, build with vs.
- to run, you might need to reconfigure startup project in vs.

The other branch builds with MinGW.
